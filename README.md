Thank you for applying to the Full Stack Engineer role at Playvation! Since a significant part of our product is a React app with associated backend API, we are looking for some React, GraphQL and Node.js skillz! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

We will be using the following example project:

https://github.com/clintonwoo/hackernews-react-graphql

This is a HackerNews frontend that visually is a copy of the original site, but rendered with React. It includes a backend implementation that takes a "snapshot" of the real HackerNews data on startup, stores it in memory, and serves it to the client using GraphQL. It is however missing a lot of functionality.

## Your task

Implement/mock some of the features that are currently missing or broken.

## More details

* Fork a github repository with the files in their initial state
* Make fixes/changes to the project, making nicely readable git commits in the process
* Document your changes as if you are explaining to a colleague what you have done (maybe through pull requests?). Explain how to test the features, and/or include unit tests.
* Send us a link to the github repo when you are done.

## Ideas for things to do

* Make it possible to comment on posts (the comments should be stored in the local backend, i.e. the comments don't need to reach the actual HackerNews backend)
* Get account creation/login to work (again, only locally)
* Make post and comment upvoting possible (again, only locally)
* Make it possible to comment using GIFs ðŸ¦„
* Comments on how data structures/code architecture could be improved is always welcome
* Improving the actual UI design
* ... and more!

## What we are looking for

* You showing off your strengths!
* Demonstration of knowledge of software architecture and data structures
* Demonstration of creating testable code
* Demonstration of good programming/git practices
* Demonstration of good communication abilities in English

## Expected time to use on this task

3-5 hours. You have one week to do the task, although message us if you need more time! If we don't hear from you after one week, we will interpret it as "not interested in the job ðŸ’©".

## Submission

Send a link to the github repo to our senior dev Ville Lindholm (e-mail in the form of firstname.lastname@playvation.com), or whatever platform you have been communicating with us on :)
